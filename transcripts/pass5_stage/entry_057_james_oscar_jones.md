# Layer 5 fidelity findings — entry #57 James Oscar Jones

**Source:** `transcripts/layer5_fidelity_audit.json` (commit `6a70838` — corpus-global fidelity sweep, 2026-05-22/23)
**Methodology:** Layer 5 is a corpus-global pass (different from per-entry Passes 1-4). It audits the relationship between the corrections overlay and the raw transcripts (D1), the consistency of canonical corrections across the corpus (D2), the alignment between per-entry rows and the cross-corpus catalog (D3), and cross-entry biographical claims (D4).

## Summary

| Dimension | Findings affecting this entry |
|---|---:|
| D1 — Phantom Whisper-renderings | 8 (0 canonical-figure / 8 low-impact) |
| D2 — Bidirectional canonical inconsistencies | 2 (cluster participations) |
| D3 — Catalog-vs-per-entry contradictions | 0 |
| D4 — Cross-entry biographical inconsistencies | 0 (corpus-wide; regex methodology limited) |

## D1 — Phantom Whisper renderings

Correction rows where the supervisor stated 'Whisper rendered X' but X is not present in this entry's raw transcript (fuzzy `partial_ratio` < 85). The rows will silently no-op when `scripts/apply_corrections.py` runs at preprocessing time — the row is dead weight in the audit overlay.

| Row ID | Pass | Claimed Whisper rendering | Canonical correction | Fuzzy score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---|
| `57.7` | Pass 1 | AM&N (Arkansas AM&N College) | Arkansas AM&N College (later UAPB) | 0.0 | low-impact |
| `57.26` | Pass 1 | Merrill High School | Merrill High School (Pine Bluff) | 0.0 | low-impact |
| `57.P2.21` | Pass 2 | Merrill High School (Pine Bluff) | Merrill High School | 0.0 | low-impact |
| `57.P2.30` | Pass 2 | Brock Hill (per cross-reference in master MD) | Rock Hill, South Carolina | 0.0 | low-impact |
| `57.P2.43` | Pass 2 | foreign foreign Stoke and all that (referring to Black Panther / Stokely Carmich | Stokely Carmichael (post-1966 Black Power era) | 0.0 | low-impact |
| `57.P2.48` | Pass 2 | Bill Hansen + Ruthie (interracial marriage in Little Rock) | Bill Hansen and Ruthie Buffington Hansen | 0.0 | low-impact |
| `57.P2.51` | Pass 2 | the Stoke and all that and the black panthers | Stokely Carmichael and the Black Panthers | 0.0 | low-impact |
| `57.P3.13` | Pass 3 | foreign foreign Stoke | Stokely Carmichael | 0.0 | low-impact |


## D2 — Bidirectional canonical inconsistency (clusters this entry participates in)

Where the same Whisper rendering across the corpus has multiple canonical corrections. The 'majority canonical' column shows which form was used by most entries — the adversarial ensemble should normalize against `civil_rights_facts.json` if the majority isn't itself the canonical form.

| Whisper rendering | This entry's correction | Majority canonical (recommended) | Variants | Total occurrences |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| ? | SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee) | SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee) | 2 | 22 |
| ? | Pertus Jones | Curtis Jones | 2 | 3 |


## D3 — Catalog-vs-per-entry contradictions

Where this entry's per-row correction disagrees with the cross-corpus catalog's canonical form for the same Whisper pattern. Most are different-referent false positives (same surface form, different historical referent) but some are genuine reconciliation candidates.

*(no D3 catalog-vs-per-entry contradictions for this entry)*


## Deploy status (per commit `2669753` — 2026-05-22 evening)

Layer 5 findings were applied to the master MD via `transcripts/fix_layer5_findings.py`:

- **0 canonical-figure phantoms** for this entry were ANNOTATED `[LAYER-5: phantom-rendering, fuzzy=NN.N, ensemble-adjudication-pending]` in the master MD (not removed — preserved for ensemble review)
- **8 low-impact phantoms** for this entry were PHYSICALLY REMOVED from the master MD (would have silently no-op'd anyway)
- D2 high-majority normalizations (≥80% share + ≥4 occurrences across the corpus) were applied automatically; this entry may participate in 0+ such normalizations
- D2 ambiguous cases were ANNOTATED `[LAYER-5: D2-ambiguous, ensemble-adjudication-pending]`
- D3 contradictions were ANNOTATED `[LAYER-5: D3-catalog-contradiction, ensemble-adjudication-pending]`

## Ensemble handoff

The annotations in the master MD's `### 57. James Oscar Jones` section identify each Layer-5-flagged row. The adversarial multi-model ensemble (Kiro / Kimi / Codex / Gemini) is the next adjudication layer for items not auto-resolved.
